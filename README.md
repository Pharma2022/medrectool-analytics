# medrectool-analytics

This is Jupyter notebook that I used to get my figures for my [medrec tool](https://medrectool.netlify.app/) .

I have built this using python and utilised the pandas library. I took advantage of the groupby feature. Given that pivot tables exist I could have done this more efficently . Also it was probably not wise to the same variable names within each cell. I would like to refactor this into a reusable function , preferably one that utilises pivot tables than relying on split apply and combine methods. I use python in the workplace every day and its a shame due to confidentiality I am unable to share further. I learnt python and the pandas library online on udemy
